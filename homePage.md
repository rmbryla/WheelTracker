# Wheel Tracker

This app helps you keep track of the cost basis of the stocks you are wheeling.
With an easy to use interface the goal is to help you make better decisions on what options contracts to sell.

This app is designed specifically for the wheel strategy, so you can add covered calls, cash secured puts, and stocks to your current list of positions, and it will automatically calculate what your current cost basis is so you can have a better idea of what your next trade should be.

Its easy to add, edit, and remove your current positions and also mark whether your options positions were assigned, expired, or closed.

Your current and past positions are stored in a google database and can be seen in the app, or exported to a csv file directly to google drive or sent in an email.

Sign in with your google account to have your data available on any device you have the app on.
